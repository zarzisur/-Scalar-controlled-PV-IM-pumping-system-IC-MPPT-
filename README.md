# -Scalar-controlled-PV-IM-pumping-system-IC-MPPT-
A Photovoltaic pumping system takes input power from the sun and converts it to mechanical power through two stages. In the 1st stage a boost converter (or any step-up DC-DC converter) does the maximum power point tracking. Then there is an inverter that drives a motor from a DC link capacitor. As the input energy source is time-varying so all the components should be operated with maximum efficiency. The system uses an induction motor which is very inefficient other than its rated operating point.  The motor is scalar controlled where quadratic voltage-frequency profile gives better result compared to linear voltage-frequency profile.![three_d](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35787202/126599632-ffe7e413-8f18-472c-9c92-50fc648a17b5.jpg)
